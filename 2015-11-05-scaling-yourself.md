I like the idea of [Polymathy][tedtalk-polymathy]. Not going to lie, it gives a very [*Multipotentialite*][tedtalk-multipotentialite] feel. Unfortunately, you can only boil so many oceans at the same time. I need to learn to outdo myself and outlast myself. Easy enuf, except <mark>guilt piles, self-loathing, and imposter syndrome</mark> are endemic in tech communities.

### Dealing with my demons

- **Stop snoozing the morning alarm**. And if I didn't get enuf sleep, I am going to have to try to sleep faster next time.
- **Stop checking the phone** during the first hour of the day. It's not going to go anywhere.
- **Stop checking emails** in the morning or night. Unless my primary job is deleting emails, it can wait till brunch or afternoon.
- **Be optimistic but never be satisfied**, like *Shimon Peres* says.
- **Jot down notes to self**, say, ideas, random thoughts, short-notes, learnings, journaling, todos and the like for future me. I can have a notebook or use a private repo on GitHub.
- **Do less, and do more of it**. It is the standard law of scale for smooth sailing. A secret sauce to outlast.
- **Block myself for important work**, say, learning new tech, reading what's new, and the like. I can use the work calendar to remind. Then I can call it research work and stop burning midnight oil.
- **Multi-task only if its completely unproductive time**. I can listen to audible when traveling, watch a movie when dining, read an article when pooping, listen to podcasts when jogging, or call a friend whilst waiting.
- **Stop reading emails as-is**. Triage them first. I can use rules and filters to sort inboxes, say, actions, invites, clients, and fyi. Then I can pay attention to the important ones.

### Dealing with the rest of the world

- **Be modest and be openminded**, like they teach in *Scandinavian schools and families*.
- **Adopt an infinite leadership mindset**, like *Simon Sinek explains in The Infinite Game*.
- **Delegate or outsource work** that is not worthy of my time, say, cleaning, cooking, gardening, laundering. I can ask an aggregator to do the work. And then make the best use of that time.
- **Limit emails for 3-5 sentences**. Not only is where my keystrokes die but they are buried inside a blackhole.
- **Stop tweeting threads and lengthy emails**. I can put that content elsewhere, say, blikies, faq, docs, git repos, gists and the like. And then share the link instead.
- **Stop getting advise** from people who don't have skin on the game. And if I fail, they would not care.
- **Hangout with people who are better than me**, like *Warren Buffett* says.

### Dealing with mint

- **Spend only what is left after saving** unless I can earn whilst sleeping.
- **Budget the expenses**, say, dues for the coming month. An app with a bullet points is all that is necessary.
- **Stop doing favors for free**, unless I run a charity organization. And limit the pro-bono to bare minimal.

### Seeking for inspiration

- **Watch and read non-technical content**, say, biographies, history, philosophy, non-fictions, true stories, and the like.
- **Learn a new skill or two** outside of day-to-day work. I can learn fiction writing and publish a book.
