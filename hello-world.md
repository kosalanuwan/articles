[GitHub](https://github.com/) use to be my unicorn and now it is _my bitch_. I interact with GitHub daily, so why not use it for journaling? It makes more sense, at least for me. Iâ€™m that nerd ðŸ¤“

The truth is I tried out all those widespread notes-taking apps from Evernote to OneNote, Workflowy, Trello, Todoist, Asana, and even Notion. For the record, they all seemed great apps but this is just my personal preference.

In case you were wondering, this journal is:

- Written on a Mac in Colombo, Sri Lanka
- Written in [Markdown](https://support.hashnode.com/docs/markdown-guidelines) with [Typora app](https://www.typora.io/)
- Served with [GitHub](https://github.com/kosalanuwan) on a private repo
- Built on [GitHub as Source](https://townhall.hashnode.com/start-using-github-to-publish-articles-on-hashnode), thanks to [@unclebigbay](https://hashnode.com/@unclebigbay)
- Originally, a flavor of a [Developer Journal](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/what-developer-journal)

You can find more about my work in [my GitHub Page](https://notestoself.hashnode.dev/opensource/).
