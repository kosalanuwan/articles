[GitHub](https://github.com/) use to be my unicorn and now it is _my bitch_.

I interact with GitHub more often than [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kosalanuwan) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosalanuwan), so why not use it for journaling? It makes more sense, at least for me. Iâ€™m that nerd ðŸ¤“

The truth is I tried out all those widespread notes-taking apps from Evernote to OneNote, Workflowy, Trello, Todoist, Asana, and even Notion. For the record, they all seemed great apps but this is just my personal preference.

### About the site
