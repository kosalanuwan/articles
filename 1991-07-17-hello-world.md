[GitHub](https://github.com/) used to be my unicorn and now it is _my bitch_.

I interact with GitHub more often than [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kosalanuwan) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosalanuwan), so why not use it for journaling? It makes more sense, at least for me. Iâ€™m that nerd ðŸ¤“

The truth is I tried out all those widespread notes-taking apps from Evernote to OneNote, Workflowy, Trello, Todoist, Asana, and even Notion. For the record, they all seemed great apps but this is just my personal preference.

### About the site

In case you were wondering, these journal notes are:

- Written on a Mac in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
- Written in [Markdown](https://support.hashnode.com/docs/markdown-guidelines) with [Typora app](https://www.typora.io/).
- Served with [GitHub](https://github.com/kosalanuwan) in a [public repo](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/keep-on-truckin/#readme).
- Published with [GitHub as Source](https://townhall.hashnode.com/start-using-github-to-publish-articles-on-hashnode), thanks to Ayodele (@[unclebigbay](@unclebigbay)) in Nigeria.
- Originally, a flavor of my [Developer Journal](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/what-developer-journal).

You can find more about my work on [my GitHub Page](https://keepontruckin.hashnode.dev/opensource/).
